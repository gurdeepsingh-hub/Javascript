# Object Oriented Programming with Javascript
OOP is a way of programming to increase the quality, performance and readability of code.
There are four pillars in OOP:
1. Abstraction : The concept of Hiding the details which we dont need out of scope, Show only essenstial.<br/>
2. Encapsulation<br/>
3. Inheritance<br/>
4. polymorphism <br/>

### Scope and Closure
Scope is the list of variables that are local to any function and gonna die after the function stops.<br/>

Closure is the list of variables which are acessible by inner functions. Closure will not die after the function stops execution.<br/>
